# Simple TCP Chat Application in C++

A basic C++ console-based chat application using TCP sockets, demonstrating client-server communication. The server listens for incoming client connections, and a single client can exchange messages with the server. This project showcases socket programming and basic networking concepts.

## Features

- **Client-Server Communication**: The server listens for a single client connection, and the client can send and receive messages to/from the server.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are sent and received instantly between the client and server.
- **Socket Programming**: Implements basic socket functionality for client-server interaction using TCP.
